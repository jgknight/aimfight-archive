		<h2>Why Fight?</h2>
			  
			<p>
				What can fighting really prove? Using a complicated algorithm, AIM® Fight crawls through
				 the depths of the Internet to answer the all-important question that plagues us all: How 
				 popular am I <em>right this second?
            </em> </p>
			
	  <h2>How do I win?</h2> 
			 
			<p>
				Your score is the sum of the current number of people online who have you listed as 
				a buddy, out to three degrees. This means the score is constantly changing, and the 
				winner of the battle will constantly change with it.
			</p> 
			
	  <h2>“Out to three degrees?” Does this have anything to do with Kevin Bacon?</h2>
			  
			<p>
				OK. It sounds a little complicated. But it’s not that bad. Here’s a diagram 
				that makes it much clearer.
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			
	  <h2>Can pacifists fight too?</h2>
			  
			<p>
				Absolutely!
			</p>
	  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
			  
			<p>
				It’s the wonders of mathematics.
			</p>
			  
	  <h2>How can I increase my score?</h2>
			  
			<p>
				You can’t! You need to get people to add you to their Buddy List® window, and have 
				more people add those people to their Buddy List windows, and have even more people add 
				those people to their Buddy List windows. Your own Buddy List window doesn’t matter in 
				the score.
			</p>
			
	  <h2>What’s AIM<sup>&reg;</sup> Rank?</h2>
			  
			<p>
				If your score happens to be in the top 5% of all AIM users online, we’ll show 
				you where you rank in comparison to the others in the top 5%.
			</p>
			  
			<p>
				If you don’t see your rank, it means you’re not in the top 5%. Remember, 
				not ranking doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. It just means that people who
				have you listed as a buddy might not be online.
			</p>
	  <h2>Why don’t bots count as buddies?</h2>
			  
			<p>
				Well, although some of us might feel a special closeness to certain bots, 
				it’s important to remember that bots aren’t real people and therefore don’t 
				count as buddies. You probably shouldn’t try to date them, either.
			</p>
			
	  <h2>What does the actual score mean?</h2>
			  
			<p>
				The higher your number, the more online third-degree connections you have. 
				Your score isn’t an exact number of your third-degree connections. Rather, it 
				shows how many connections you have relative to other AIM users.
			</p>
			
	  <h2>Who made AIM Fight?</h2>
			  
			<p>
				Two AIM programmers with a little bit too much free time on their hands. 
				They’re both mild-mannered, soft-spoken, and nonviolent people. Go figure.
